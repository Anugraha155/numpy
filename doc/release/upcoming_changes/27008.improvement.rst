Improved ``numpy.dtypes`` type hints
------------------------------------

The type annotations for ``numpy.dtypes`` are now a better reflection of the
runtime:
The ``numpy.dtype`` type-aliases have been replaced with specialized ``dtype``
*subtypes*, and the previously missing annotations for
``numpy.dtypes.StringDType`` have been added.
